Repo that contains the code of my Master Thesis work:

Data Re-Uploading in Quantum Variational Q-Learning

To train agents in paralel, run the following command:

``` python
python main.py "path_to_config"
```

where "path_to_config" is the path to the configuration file.

The Analysis done in the research paper "VQC-Based Reinforcement Learning with Data Re-uploading: Performance and Trainability" is in
