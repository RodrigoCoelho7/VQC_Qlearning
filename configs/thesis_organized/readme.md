This folder will contain the configs for the experiments as they will appear on the thesis. The configs are going to be organized in subfolders, as follows:

1) Skolik Replication Studies (Performance and Gradients)
    1.1) Skolik with data re-uploading, input scaling and output scaling vs baseline with input scaling and output scaling
         Skolik baseline, with and without input scaling and output scaling
         Skolik with data re-uploading, with and without input scaling and output scaling
    1.2) Single Qubit UQC
